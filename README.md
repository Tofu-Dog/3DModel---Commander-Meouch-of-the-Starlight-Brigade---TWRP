	1. Download the VR Chat Creator Companion https://vrchat.com/home/download
	2. Make a new project.
	3. Drag the 'VRChat Avatars' Package into your project assests folder and extract everything.
	4. Double click 'Load this'. Two versions of Meouch should appear.
	5. Click VRChat SDK at the top.
	6. Click show control panel
	7. Log-in to your VRChat account
	8. Click on the 'Builder' tab.
	9. At the bottom of the window, check the box saying you have permission to upload the model.

	It should now be in the Uploaded Avatars section in VRChat!

	I want to create a world to make it easier to get the avatar one day, but for now this is what you'll have to do.

	If you have any trouble, this tutorial should help! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSwMz4WcajQ
